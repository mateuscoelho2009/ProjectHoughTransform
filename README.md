# ProjectHoughTransform

This project focus on an evaluation of the Hough Transform over different situations.

## Study Objects

* Trees
* Roundabouts
* Sport Balls
* Bacteria

## Implementation

The development of this project will be splited into 2 evaluation phases:
- OpenCV-aided sequential implementation;
- OpenCV-aided parallel implementation;

This is a Python project.

For the first phase, the development will be done for comparison purposes, since the results of the second phase are the study object.

For the second phase, the tool for parallel processing is yet to be decided.
